### 👋 Slide 1: Title

**“Good [morning/afternoon], everyone. My name is Chaitanya, and today I’ll be presenting a data-driven analysis of our retail sales, with the goal of supporting both our CEO and CMO in strategic decision-making. This presentation covers cleaned data insights from 2011, using Tableau visualizations, to guide planning, marketing, and expansion efforts.”**

---

### 🧼 Slide 2: Data Cleaning – Foundation for Accurate Insights

**“Before beginning any analysis, it was essential to clean the dataset to ensure we were working with accurate information. Two critical checks were applied:**

- **Any sales record with quantity less than 1 was removed, as these typically represent product returns.**
- **Entries with a unit price below $0 were excluded, as these are clear data entry errors.**

**This step ensures that the insights derived from this data are credible and can be used confidently for making business decisions.”**

---

### 📈 Slide 3: Q1 – Monthly Revenue Trend (2011)

**“For our first question, the CEO wanted to analyze monthly revenue trends across 2011 to identify any seasonal patterns.**

- **The visualization here shows a clear spike in revenue during November and December, consistent with holiday season buying behavior.**
- **There’s also a smaller increase around mid-year, possibly linked to back-to-school or summer campaigns.**

**Recognizing these trends is key to preparing for future demand surges—whether that’s optimizing inventory, adjusting marketing campaigns, or scaling up logistics. This trendline becomes a solid foundation for 2022 and 2023 forecasting.”**

### 🌍 Slide 4: Q2 – Top 10 Countries by Revenue (Excluding UK)

**“Next, for the CMO, I analyzed the top 10 countries generating the highest revenue—excluding the United Kingdom to focus on international opportunities.**

- **The bar chart compares revenue and quantity sold side by side.**
- **Countries like the Netherlands, Germany, and France stand out not only in revenue but also in units sold, indicating both high demand and solid average pricing.**

**This visualization can guide marketing efforts and promotional planning. For example, higher revenue but lower quantity might signal premium pricing potential, while high quantity but lower revenue might suggest a discount-driven market.”**

---

### 👤 Slide 5: Q3 – Top 10 Customers by Revenue

**“The third question again serves the CMO, who wanted to identify the top 10 revenue-generating customers.**

- **The chart here ranks customers in descending order by total revenue.**

**It also opens the door for potential account-based marketing strategies, ensuring our high-value customers feel recognized and supported.”**

**From a strategic standpoint, this chart helps us identify markets that are already performing well and could benefit from further investment—whether that’s marketing, fulfillment centers, or localized partnerships.”**
