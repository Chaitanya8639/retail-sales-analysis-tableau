# Retail Sales Analysis with Tableau
Welcome to the repository for my completed TATA Data Visualisation Virtual Experience Program hosted on The Forage. This simulation mimics real-world tasks performed by data analysts and visualisation professionals at TATA, focusing on insights-driven business reporting.
## 📊 Project Overview
This project presents a data-driven analysis of retail sales using Tableau. The goal was to address key questions raised by the CEO and CMO regarding revenue trends, customer performance, and regional demand, using 2011 sales data.

## 📌 Task Breakdown

 ### ✅ Task 1: Data Cleaning
- Removed rows with negative quantities and zero/negative unit prices
- Filtered transactions for the year 2011
- Ensured consistent column formatting

### ✅ Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis
- Framed the business questions from the CEO's & CMO’s perspective:
- What are the monthly revenue trends?
- Which international countries (excluding the UK) are performing best?
- Who are our top customers?
- Where should we expand next?

### ✅ Task 3: Data Visualisation
- Created key visualisations using Power BI:
- Line chart for monthly revenue trends
- Bar chart for the top 10 countries by revenue (excluding the UK)
- Bar chart for the top 10 customers by revenue
- Map chart to highlight expansion opportunities by demand

### ✅ Task 4: Presentation
- Delivered a clear 5-minute business presentation answering stakeholder questions using insights from visualised data, including:
- Seasonality awareness (e.g., revenue peak in November)
- Expansion markets (e.g., Netherlands, Ireland, Australia)
- Retention strategy for high-value customers

## 🔍 Business Questions Answered
