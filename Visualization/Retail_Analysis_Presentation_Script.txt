🧼 Slide 1: Data Cleaning – Foundation for Accurate Insights

Talking Points:
- “Before starting any analysis, I cleaned the dataset to ensure only valid and reliable data was used.”
- “I applied two key checks:
    1. Quantity >= 1 to remove returns and negative entries.
    2. Unit Price >= $0 to exclude erroneous pricing.”
- “This ensures that all downstream visualizations reflect only genuine sales transactions, which improves decision-making accuracy.”

Talking Points:

Visualization Insight: Bar chart with Revenue and Quantity

Talking Points:
